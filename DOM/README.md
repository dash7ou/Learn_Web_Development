## Document Object Model - DOM

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects. That way, programming languages can connect to the page.

A Web page is a document. This document can be either displayed in the browser window or as the HTML source. But it is the same document in both cases. The Document Object Model (DOM) represents that same document so it can be manipulated. The DOM is an object-oriented representation of the web page, which can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.

***For Example:***

This example explan how we get paragraph from our html file using its id;

```js

    const para = document.getElementById("para");
    const para = document.querySelector("#para");

```

* [Call Me Nick - DOM Manipulation Basics (archived version)](https://web.archive.org/web/20170718105716/https://callmenick.com/post/basics-javascript-dom-manipulation) will cover a lot of the basics.

* As a good start we will start with [W3School](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom.asp). you will learn dom method, dom with css , dom event and so on.

* [MDN article on "Manipulating Documents"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Manipulating_documents) - useful for some further reading, if you'd like

* [Appspot's DOM Tutorials:](https://dom-tutorials.appspot.com/static/index.html) Exercises 1,2 & 3 only will help put that into practice.

* [The ODIN Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/dom-manipulation) i like this document :).

* [This document](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model) will explan all method in dom interfaces, you are not required to study all functions for information only.
